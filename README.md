## About

Purpose of this repository is to research better, faster, smarter LLMs.

This repository contains cutting-edge language model experiments and architectures. We believe scientists do their best work when given freedom to explore, so this is a space for your independent research and discovery.

Fork this repository, create a new experiment in `experiments/` folder, then create a pull request to merge it back.

## Experiments

> Some of the experiments below are validated on a specific git tag. 
> Later commits may introduce breaking changes. 
> If experiment includes *Validated Tag* field, it may still run, but if it doesn't, use: `git checkout <tag-name>`
> 
> **Latest stable tag**: `experiments-v2.0` (for Exp6-8)

### [Exp7: Hybrid DeltaNet Architecture Ablation](experiments/exp7_hybrid_deltanet_ablation/)
- **Validated Tag**: `git checkout experiments-v2.0`
- Comprehensive ablation of 13 architectures (0-100% attention) finding that Hybrid Sparse 17% (2 attention layers at positions 5, 11) performs 27% better than pure Transformer and 8% better than pure DeltaNet.

### [Exp6: Gated DeltaNet Training](experiments/exp6_gated_deltanet_training/)
- **Validated Tag**: `git checkout experiments-v2.0`
- Learning rate ablation study for Gated DeltaNet architecture, finding 1e-3 optimal for 188M parameter model. Also possible to train coherent LLM in 30-60 min on H100.

### [Exp5: Batch Size vs Sequence Length](experiments/exp5_batch_vs_seqlen_ablation/)
- **Researcher**: Vuk Rosić ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XJj9pv_11a11FUxCMz15g), [GitHub](https://github.com/vukrosic))
- **Validated Tag**: `git checkout experiments-v2.0`
- **Research Question**: Should you use big batches with short sequences, or small batches with long sequences?
- **Key Findings**: A balanced approach to batch size and sequence length (e.g., 26x1024) is most effective. It outperforms both large batches with short sequences and small batches with long sequences. While large batches may seem to train faster, longer sequences ultimately provide better learning.

### [Exp4: AMP vs FP32 on T4](experiments/exp4_amp_fp32_t4/)
- **Researcher**: Sumner Marston ([GitHub](https://github.com/Summykai))
- **Research Question**: When should you use mixed precision (FP16) vs full precision (FP32) on an NVIDIA T4 GPU?
- **Key Findings**: On a T4 GPU, mixed precision (AMP) is up to 2x faster than full precision (FP32) when processing over 600-1,000 tokens at once. Larger models benefit from AMP with fewer tokens, while smaller models require more tokens to see a speedup.

### [Exp3: PLASA + GDN Hybrid](experiments/exp3_plasa_gdn_hybrid/)
- **Researcher**: Overtimepog ([GitHub](https://github.com/overtimepog))
- **Validated Tag**: `git checkout experiments-v1.0`
- **Research Question**: 
  1. Can per-layer adaptive sparse attention (PLASA) with progressive sparsity scheduling improve upon the uniform sparse attention tested in Exp1?
  2. Does the PROGRESSIVE_SPARSE schedule align with transformer layer hierarchy (dense early layers, aggressive sparse middle layers, moderate sparse late layers)?
  3. Which combination produces the best efficiency-performance tradeoff across 11 patterns (pure architectures + PLASA hybrids + Original hybrids)?
- **Key Findings**: A full Per-Layer Adaptive Sparse Attention (PLASA) architecture is optimal. It significantly improves validation loss, accuracy, and training speed compared to hybrid models or full attention. The results also confirm that applying progressively sparser attention to the middle layers of a transformer is a highly effective strategy.

### [Exp1: DSA + GDN Hybrid](experiments/exp1_dsa_gdn_hybrid/)
- **Researcher**: Vuk Rosić ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XJj9pv_11a11FUxCMz15g), [GitHub](https://github.com/vukrosic))
- **Validated Tag**: `git checkout experiments-v1.0`
- **Research Question**: 
  1. Can replacing full attention with DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) improve the efficiency and performance of a hybrid attention architecture that combines full attention and Gated DeltaNet (GDN)?
  2. Which combination of attention mechanisms across layers produces the best efficiency-performance tradeoff: (1) Full Attention + GDN, (2) DSA + GDN, (3) DSA only, or (4) Full Attention only?
- **Key Findings**: Using DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) in a hybrid model with Gated DeltaNet (GDN) provides faster initial training. However, full attention seems to achieve better performance over longer training runs. The optimal combination of attention mechanisms still requires more research.
