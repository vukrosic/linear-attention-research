# Blueberry LLM

**Open Superintelligence Lab** - Open research for everyone. We publish all of our research for the sake of accelerating science. Learn real AI research from a real research lab.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python train_moe.py
```

## About

Purpose of this repository is to research better, faster, smarter LLMs.

This repository contains cutting-edge language model experiments and architectures. We believe scientists do their best work when given freedom to explore, so this is a space for your independent research and discovery.

Fork this repository, create a new experiment in `experiments/` folder, then create a pull request to merge it back.

## Experiments


## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy
2. Clone your fork: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/vukrosic/linear-attention-research.git`
   - **If you forgot `--recursive`**: Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize the submodules
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
5. Create your own experiment and merge it
6. Explore the `experiments/` folder for ongoing research and inspiration
7. Once you finish with your research, create a pull request to merge it back to this repo

## Philosophy

We don't prescribe what to research. Instead, we provide:
- Freedom to explore interesting ideas
- Infrastructure to test hypotheses
- A collaborative environment for learning

## Structure

- **`experiments/`** - Research experiments with their own documentation
- **`models/`** - Model architectures and implementations (DeepSeek, Qwen3-Next)
- **`training/`** - Training scripts and utilities
- **`configs/`** - Configuration files
